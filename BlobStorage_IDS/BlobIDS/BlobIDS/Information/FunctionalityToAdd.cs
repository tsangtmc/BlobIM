         * that way it would be possible to tell if blob storage was even accessed in a possibly malicious way
         * e.g: if blob is accessed massively at 3 am, it might be supicious
         * it is atleast possible to recognize other patterns like a bunch of failed login attempts
         * or also files being read which usually are not...
         * 
         * 
         * add functionality, such as button on ui, to check blob permissions on click .. for like pentesting
